# Friend-Finder
Friend Finder is a full stack web application that will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from the cast of Friends and other users and find the best match. The app will then display the name and picture of the "Friend" with the best overall match.

# Getting Started
Make sure you install all the dependencies you need for the project, including Node.js.

Once you have these installed, navigate to the directory adn enter the following commands into terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:linh0404/Friend-Finder.git
cd friend-finder
npm init
npm install
node server.js
```

# How it works
Using it is super simple. Once you've run it on your local server, you can go to your localhost:8080 from any browser and the website should be up and running. 

Click on the "Take Survey" button and fill out your details to find your new best friend!
